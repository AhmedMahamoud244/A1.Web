        <h1>About me.........</h1>
<div>
        <p>   My name is Ahmed Mahamoud I'm a 22-year-old that was born and raised in America for 5 years. I moved to Canada when I was 5 years old and have been here ever since.
            When I first moved to Toronto I didn't like it at first. But when I started making friends and started learning my way around the city It became the best city.
            My background is Somali I come from a big family of 20 siblings there are 12 girls and 8 boys. In my family, I'm the Second youngest.
            The youngest is my little sister that's 19 years old. Most of my siblings don't live here some live in England, and America and some stay in Canada.
            My Mom and Dad are both born and raised in Somalia and then immigrated here after the war started in Somalia.
            As a kid, I didn't need a lot of friends when I had so many siblings they would be my best friends.
            As a kid I used to play Soccer it countied until I got to college. I was awarded player of the year on most of the teams I played on and also at one point
            got a chance to practice with some athletes. It all come to an end when I got injured and broke my leg in 2 different places. After that I just wanted to go to school I applied to York university for business
            and got in after 1 year in I realized it wasn't for me and just took a year off. Then Covid hit and everything was online so I just took some more time off
            intill school became inclass teaching. While in lockdown I started my sneaker and designer business.
            And I will touch up on my business more on the next page.
