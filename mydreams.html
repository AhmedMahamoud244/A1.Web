        <h1>My Dreams........</h1>

        <p>My dreams are to finish this program and get a good job after and make good money to support my mom and dad and show them.How much I  appreciate them me for raising me and my siblings for so many years and not asking for anything in return. They  deserve the world and I just want to make sure they are ok in life. I started my sneaker and designer business. I sell sneakers for resale and make ok profit from it.This is jsut something to support me while i go though school.
</p>

<h2>My Business</h2>
<p> I run a reselling business on the side. I started this business during covid we were all locked in the house so I just started it and it has taken off from there. But I don't see it as a stable way of earning income.
    But this Program will help me build a website for my business and it will also help me put my stock and what I'm selling on it on to the web and I feel like it would help my busniess out alot.
    
Down below are some sneakers we sell and thier sizes
